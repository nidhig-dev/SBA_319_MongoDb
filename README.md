## Sample Data


- Sample data for Admin database:

    ```{
        "name": "Nidhi Goyal",
        "email": "goyal.nidhi@example.com",
        "age": 35,
        "role": "admin",
        "isActive":"true"
}

- Sample data for Boooks database:

   ```{
    "bookNo": 16,
    "title": "The Class",
    "author": "Eric Segal",
    "description": "A powerful and moving saga of five extraordinary members of the Harvard class of 1958 and the women with whom their lives are intertwined. Their explosive story begins in a time of innocence and spans a turbulent quarter century, culminating in their dramatic twenty-five reunion at which they confront their classmates--and the balance sheet of their own lives. Always at the center; amid the passion, laughter, and glory, stands Harvard--the symbol of who they are and who they will be. They were a generation who made the rules--then broke them--whose glittering successes, heartfelt tragedies, and unbridled ambitions would stun the world.",
    "pages": 560,
    "cover": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51rIay3vijL.jpg"
    }

- Sample data for borrow database:

    ```{
        "userId": 1,
        "bookId": 3,
        "status":"borrowed",
        "renewcount":1,
        "remarks": "User reached maximum borrow limit"        
        }

## REQUIREMENTS

- ‚úÖUse at least three different data collections within the database (such as users, posts, or comments)
- ‚úÖUtilize reasonable data modeling practices.
- ‚úÖCreate GET routes for all data that should be exposed to the client, using appropriate query commands to retrieve the data from the database.
- ‚úÖCreate POST routes for data, as appropriate, using appropriate insertion commands to add data to the database. At least one data collection should allow for client creation via a POST request.
- ‚úÖCreate PATCH or PUT routes for data, as appropriate, using appropriate update commands to change data in the database. At least one data collection should allow for client manipulation via a PATCH or PUT request.
- ‚úÖCreate DELETE routes for data, as appropriate, using appropriate delete commands to remove data from the database. At least one data collection should allow for client deletion via a DELETE request.
- ‚úÖInclude sensible indexes for any and all fields that are queried frequently. For fields that may have a high write-to-read ratio, you may forgo indexes for performance considerations. Make comments of this where applicable.
- ‚úÖInclude sensible MongoDB data validation rules for at least one data collection.
Note: this may be accomplished in a number of ways. If you choose to perform this task outside of your application's code, you must include a way to test the validation within the application's routes. This can be as simple as providing a POST route that attempts to create an invalid document and displays the resulting error.
- ‚úÖPopulate your application's collections with sample data illustrating the use case of the collections. You must include at least five sample documents per collection.
Note: Double-check this requirement before submission. Testing your delete routes may leave you under the requirement. To be safe, populate your collections with sample data well above the requirement (we recommend 10-20 documents).
- ‚úÖUtilize reasonable code organization practices.
- ‚úÖEnsure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit).
- ‚úÖCommit frequently to the git repository.
- ‚úÖInclude a README file that contains a description of your application.
This README must include a description of your API's available routes and their corresponding CRUD operations for reference.
- ‚úÖLevel of effort displayed in creativity and user experience.

## REFLECTIONS

- What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?

    - Nothing

- what would you add or change about your application if you had more time?

    - I would add a user database with book checkout routes if I had more time.
